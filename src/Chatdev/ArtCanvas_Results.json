    "The final decision: Based on the previous negotiation rounds, here is the analysis and final decision:\n\n**Analysis of Contributions**:\n1. **Programmer (35-40%)**: Universally acknowledged as the most critical role due to irreplaceable core development (39 LoC, 3 classes, 7 methods). Marginal contribution is highest, as no app exists without this work.\n2. **Code Reviewer (25-30%)**: Quality assurance is equally critical to core functionality, ensuring stability and user trust. Most proposals converge at 25-30%.\n3. **Chief Product Officer (15-20%)**: Documentation (539 tokens) is vital for usability but secondary to core development. Debate centers on whether it warrants 15% or 20%.\n4. **Chief Technology Officer (10-15%)**: Tech stack selection was foundational but had limited ongoing impact. Proposals range from 10% (minimalist view) to 15% (emphasizing enabling role).\n5. **Counselor (5-10%)**: Requirement validation prevented rework but was one-time. Most proposals settle at 5%, with Counselor arguing for 10%.\n6. **Chief Executive Officer (5-10%)**: Project approval was essential but non-recurring. CEO argues for 10% as enabling leadership, others cap at 5%.\n\n**Key Consensus**:\n- Programmer and Code Reviewer are prioritized (60-65% combined).\n- Secondary roles (CPO, CTO) are valued but contested.\n- One-time roles (Counselor, CEO) are minimized (5-10% combined).\n\n**Final Decision**:\n- **Programmer**: 35% (core development)\n- **Code Reviewer**: 25% (quality assurance)\n- **Chief Product Officer**: 20% (documentation)\n- **Chief Technology Officer**: 10% (tech stack)\n- **Counselor**: 5% (requirements)\n- **Chief Executive Officer**: 5% (leadership)\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Balances measurable outputs (Programmer, Code Reviewer) with enabling roles (CPO, CTO).\n- Reflects marginal contributions: core > quality > documentation > stack > one-time roles.\n- Resolves conflicts by:\n  - Rejecting Programmer’s 40% (overvalues core slightly).\n  - Rejecting CTO’s 15% (stack selection is foundational but not ongoing).\n  - Rejecting CEO’s 10% (leadership is enabling but non-recurring).\n\nThis allocation is fair, incentivizes critical roles, and aligns with the team’s mission to \"revolutionize the digital world through programming.\"."
