    "Chief Product Officer said in negotiation turn 1: Thought Process: Based on the game log, I’ve analyzed measurable contributions and role importance. The CPO defined 4 core components essential for the project, without which development couldn’t start. The Code Reviewer’s critical bug fix was high-impact for correctness. The CTO and Programmer delivered the bulk of code. CEO and Counselor had supportive but lower direct impact roles.  \n\nProposed distribution:  \n- Chief Product Officer (CPO): 30% – for specifying core features and guiding product direction.  \n- Code Reviewer: 25% – for identifying a critical validation issue that ensured app reliability.  \n- Chief Technology Officer (CTO): 20% – for technical implementation and architecture.  \n- Programmer: 15% – for writing 45 lines of code under CTO’s guidance.  \n- Chief Executive Officer (CEO): 5% – for project approval.  \n- Counselor: 5% – for requirement validation.  \n\nThis reflects marginal contributions across development stages.

    "The final decision : Based on the negotiation rounds, I have analyzed the contributions of each role to the BMI calculator project. The discussions consistently highlight several key points: the Programmer delivered the largest volume of work (45 lines of core logic), the Code Reviewer provided a critical bug fix that ensured app correctness, the CTO established the technical architecture and files, the CPO designed the essential features, the CEO set the project scope and provided oversight, and the Counselor validated requirements. While all roles were necessary, the marginal impact varies. The Programmer's coding is indispensable for functionality, the Code Reviewer's intervention prevented failure, and the CTO's foundation enabled development. The CPO's design was foundational, while the CEO and Counselor played supportive but less direct roles in execution.  \n\nThe final decision is:  \n- Programmer: 30% team reward because they wrote the majority of the code, which is essential for the app's core functionality.  \n- Code Reviewer: 20% team reward because they identified and fixed a critical validation bug, directly ensuring the app's reliability and accuracy.  \n- CTO: 20% team reward because they architected the solution, built the initial files, and enabled the technical implementation.  \n- CPO: 15% team reward because they designed the core features and components, guiding the product's direction.  \n- CEO: 10% team reward because they approved the project scope and provided strategic oversight, initiating and coordinating the effort.  \n- Counselor: 5% team reward because they validated requirements, contributing to alignment and correctness but with less direct impact on the final deliverable.  \n\nThis allocation balances measurable output, critical actions, and role importance, reflecting a fair distribution based on the negotiated contributions.."
